          <h3>What is Tax Planning?</h3>
          <p>Tax planning is an analysis of a financial plan from a tax perspective. The purpose of tax planning is to
            ensure tax efficiency, with the elements of the financial plan working together in the most tax-efficient
            manner possible. Tax planning is an important part of a financial plan, as reducing tax liability and
            maximizing eligibility to contribute to retirement plans are both crucial for success. It is not a device to
            reduce tax burden but helps to save by investments in government securities.
            <br />
            <br />
            Savings reduce extravagance, and correspondingly inflation. Tax savings are permitted only for an investment
            made in government securities and bonds of priority sectors which ultimately help the nation. Therefore, the
            savings in tax help the Central and state governments to mobilize funds by way of investments and as such
            the government earns much by way of other benefits, by sacrificing a small amount of tax.
          </p>

        <header class="section-header">
          <h3>Savings and investments are interconnected</h3>
          <p>
            Before making investments the person has to consider various factors such as:
            <br /> <strong> Liquidity </strong></Liquidity> <br />when he requires the amount to meet the educational
            expenses of children, for marriage, house construction or for a secure future after retirement.
            <br /> <strong> Security of the investment.</strong>
            <br /> <strong> The return and tax on income on such investments.</strong> <br />
            Factors of tax planning varies from one person to other. A person by investing in NSC saves on his tax.
            Whereas, the interest on the investment is taxable. If the investment is made in PPF, he is not liable to
            pay the income tax on interest. But the period of NSC is six years whereas in the case of PPF the period of
            repayment is 5 years. However, a portion can be claimed after 7years. Thus the person who makes the
            investment has to consider whether he requires the amount after 5 years or he can wait for a longer period.
